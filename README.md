# React Playground Project

This project is a personal playground for experimenting with React.  
It combines various functionalities and features that React has to offer.
I try out things like components, props, and state management and move on to more advanced patterns as I continue to explore.

---

## What This Is

- A place to practice and build small features using React (with TypeScript and Vite)
- An evolving project: things may change or break as I try new ideas
- A collection of mini-experiments, not a polished final product

### Current Features:

- Task list

---

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling

---

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyBraak/playground.git
cd playground
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Goals

- Learn and experiment with React's core features
- Practice TypeScript in a React context
- Explore concepts like conditional rendering, state updates, forms, and more
- Keep code readable and clean as a habit

## Notes

This project is not meant to be deployed in production. It's just for learning and personal growth. Feel free to explore or use it as a reference if you're learning React!
